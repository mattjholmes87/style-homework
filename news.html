            >A man has appeared in court charged with soliciting to commit
            murder over an alleged plot to kidnap TV presenter Holly

          >
          Gavin Plumb, of Potters Field, in Harlow, Essex, is also accused of
          incitement to commit kidnap. The 36-year-old, who is a security
          officer at a shopping precinct in the town, appeared for a short
          hearing at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court. Willoughby did not appear on
          Thursday's edition of ITV show This Morning. She was reported to be
          under police protection at her home on Thursday night.

        Mr Plumb, who was wearing a green T-shirt with the slogan "Aged to
        Perfection", was remanded in custody to appear for a plea hearing at
        Chelmsford Crown Court on 3 November. He is accused of "soliciting,
        encouraging, persuading, endeavouring to persuade or proposing to a
        third party" to murder Willoughby between Tuesday and Wednesday. It is
        also alleged that between Monday and Thursday, he was "formulating a
        plan with a third party". He allegedly "encouraged that third party to
        travel to the UK to carry out the plan" and was "assembling a kidnap and
        restraint kit, capable of encouraging or assisting the commission of the
        kidnap" of Willoughby. The other man was due to arrive in the UK next
        week from the US, the court heard.

        In a statement, Det Supt Rob Kirby of Essex Police said: "This was an
        extremely fast-paced investigation, with many of our officers and
        national partners working overnight to secure these charges. "The
        safeguarding of any victim is paramount and we will continue to
        prioritise this and working with the Metropolitan Police Service as the
        investigation proceeds." A spokesperson for ITV said: "This news has
        come as a huge shock to everyone at This Morning and ITV. "We are
        providing all of the support we can to Holly and her family at this
        incredibly distressing time."
